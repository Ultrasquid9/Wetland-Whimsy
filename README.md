### About

Wetland Whimsy is a mod which completely overhauls Minecraft's swamps! It includes a whole new subbiome, several new plants and blocksets, and ancient ruins that dot the landscape of these overhauled wetlands. While these ruins contain plenty of treasure, be warned - some of them may not be as abandoned as they first seem!

Features:

*   **Bald Cypress**, a new tree type that can be found in wetlands.
*   **Limestone**, a new stone type found below the water in wetlands.
*   **Cordgrass** and **Pennywort**, two new plants to add a touch of whimsy to your gardens.
*   **Bloodcap Mushrooms**, toxic mushrooms found within the deepslate layer. Don't inhale their spores!
*   **Aria Mushrooms**, rare bioluminescent mushrooms that can be placed on walls.
*   **The Marsh**, a flat wetland covered in Cordgrass that can be found between bogs and the ocean.
*   **Wetland Ruins**, ancient structures built from limestone with plenty of loot for those who look.
*   **The Swamp Dungeon**, a mysterious, mazelike structure built for an unknown purpose. **Ancient Pots** with **strange symbols** may be found down there... their loot may not be that great, but maybe there's a way to improve it?

### Compatibility

Wetland Whimsy uses biome modifiers to modify the vanilla Swamp, meaning it should be compatible with most other mods that redo the Swamp biome as well! This is true for both the 1.21.1 and the 1.20.1 releases, so you don't need to worry about adding this mod to any of your modpacks. 

Currently, Wetland Whimsy has explicit support for **YUNGs Better Witch Huts**, **YUNGs Extras**, and **Supplementaries**. Additionally, it has been tested with **Nature's Spirit**, **Swampier Swamps**, and **Extra Compat**, all with no isssues. If you are unsure if a mod will be compatible, try it out! The worst that could happen is that they aren't.

### Version Support

Wetland Whimsy currently supports **Neoforge 1.21.1** and **Forge 1.20.1**. A port to Neoforge 1.21.4 will come in the near future!

Unfortunately, this mod will not have official Fabric support. Maintaining one modloader is already difficult and time-consuming, two would be too much for me to handle. However, this mod is **free and open-source**, so if you know how to port it and would like to, go ahead!
