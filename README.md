### About
Wetland Whimsy is a mod which completely overhauls Minecraft's swamps! It includes a whole new subbiome, several new plants and blocksets, and ancient ruins that dot the landscape of these overhauled wetlands. While these ruins contain plenty of treasure, be warned - some of them may have trials you need to face first!

Features:
- **Bald Cypress**, a new tree type that can be found in wetlands.
- **Limestone**, a new stone type found below the water in wetlands.
- **Cordgrass** and **Pennywort**, two new plants to add a touch of whimsy to your gardens. 
- **The Bog**, a forested swamp containing Bald Cypress and large mushrooms. 
- **The Marsh**, a flat wetland covered in Cordgrass that can be found between bogs and the ocean. 
- **Wetland Ruins**, ancient structures built from limestone with plenty of loot for those who look. 

### Compatibility
Since vanilla Minecraft's Swamp does several weird behind-the-scenes stuff, Wetland Whimsy **removes it entirely**, replacing it with the Bog and the Marsh. This means that mods that depend on the vanilla swamp biome may be incompatible. 

Currently, Wetland Whimsy supports **YUNGs Better Witch Huts** and **YUNGs Extras**. If you are unsure if a mod will be compatible, try it out! The worst that could happen is that they aren't.

### Version Support
Wetland Whimsy currently supports **Neoforge 1.21.1**. Ports to Forge 1.20.1 and Neoforge 1.21.4 will come in the near future!

Unfortunately, this mod will not have official Fabric support. Maintaining one modloader is already difficult and time-consuming, two would be too much for me to handle. However, this mod is **free and open-source**, so if you know how to port it and would like to, go ahead!
