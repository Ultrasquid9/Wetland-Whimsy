# Wetland Whimsy

Wetland Whimsy is a mod which completely overhauls Minecraft's swamps! It includes a whole new subbiome, several new plants and blocksets, and ancient ruins that dot the landscape of these overhauled wetlands. While these ruins contain plenty of treasure, be warned - some of them may not be as abandoned as they first seem!

This is the Wetland Whimsy Github repository, which contains its code and assets. If you just want to download the mod, you can find it on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/wetland-whimsy) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wetland-whimsy).

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! If you wish to contribute, please keep the following in mind:

- Ensure your contribution is consistently formatted, and uses one tab for indentation.

- If your contribution includes assets or data (e.g. a language file, or a texture change), ensure that they are placed in `src/main/resources/...` instead of `src/generated/resources/...`. The latter is used by datagen scripts, so files placed there will be overwritten. 

- All contributions should be licenced under the Artistic 2.0 license, or another compatible license. If you do not specify the license of your contribution, it will be considered to be licensed under Artistic 2.0.
