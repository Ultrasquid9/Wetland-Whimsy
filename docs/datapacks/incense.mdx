title: Incense
---

If you are a mod or modpack developer, you can add custom Incense using a datapack. Custom incense files go in the `data/my_mod/wetland_whimsy/incense` folder.

Here is an example Incense file:

```json
{
	"item": "my_mod:my_item",
	"loot_table": "my_mod:incense/my_loot_table",
	"color": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
	"entities": [
		"minecraft:creeper",
		"my_mod:my_entity"
	]
}
```

The fields are as follows:

### Item
`item`

This contains the resource location of any item. Some examples would be `minecraft:dirt`, `aether:zanite_pickaxe`, or `wetland_whimsy:ancient_coin`.

<Callout variant="warning">
	The item must be tagged with `wetland_whimsy:incense`, otherwise it will not be recognized
</Callout>

### Loot Table
`loot_table`

This contains the resource location of any loot table. It is recommended to place incense loot tables inside of an `incense` subfolder, but this is completely optional and the loot table may be placed in whatever subfolder you desire (or none at all).

### Color
`color`

This contains an array of floats, representing RGB values. Each one goes from `0` to `1`.

<Callout>
	I have no clue what happens if you set it higher than 1.
</Callout>

### Entities
`entities`

This contains an array of resource locations for entities. It may include as few or as many as you wish. I personally recommend around 4.
